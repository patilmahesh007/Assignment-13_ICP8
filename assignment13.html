            The story follows a group of strangers who find themselves stranded at a secluded cabin after their bus
            breaks down. As they wait for help to arrive, tensions rise and secrets begin to surface among the group.

            As the storm rages outside, paranoia and suspicion escalate inside the cabin. Strange occurrences and
            unexplained phenomena heighten the sense of unease, leading the characters to question each other's motives
            and sanity.

            Meanwhile, one of the passengers, a former detective haunted by a cold case from his past, becomes convinced
            that one of the others is a murderer hiding in plain sight among them. As he delves deeper into the mystery,
            he uncovers shocking revelations about each of the passengers, forcing them to confront their darkest
            secrets and deepest fears.

            As the storm worsens and the group's situation becomes increasingly desperate, they must band together to
            survive the night while also unraveling the chilling truth behind the cabin's sinister history and the
            identity of the killer in their midst.
